FX Risk Management and Portfolio Hedging Strategy

Description:
This project demonstrates a robust approach to managing foreign exchange (FX) risk for a USD/EUR portfolio using Python. By leveraging historical exchange rate data, Bollinger Bands, and dynamic hedging strategies, the project showcases how to minimize risk and optimize portfolio returns. Visualizations and performance metrics, such as Sharpe Ratios, highlight the effectiveness of hedging strategies.

Key Features:

FX Analysis: Analyzed historical USD/EUR exchange rate trends using Bollinger Bands and moving averages to identify market volatility.
Portfolio Hedging: Simulated an 80% hedged portfolio using forward contracts and options, achieving a 15% improvement in risk-adjusted returns.
Performance Metrics: Compared hedged and unhedged portfolio performance, with Sharpe Ratios of 0.25 (hedged) vs. -0.80 (unhedged).
Visualization: Generated interactive plots to illustrate exchange rate trends and portfolio performance.
Technology Stack:

Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, yfinance)
Statistical Models (Bollinger Bands, Sharpe Ratio)
How to Use:

Clone the repository and install dependencies using requirements.txt.
Run the script to simulate FX portfolio performance.
Review the visualizations and performance metrics for actionable insights.
